      <li>Where should you use constants, and where should you use variables? Can they all be constants?</li>
      <p>
				The difference between a constant and a variable is that a constant is a value that cannot be changed, while a variable is a value that can be changed, so they cannot all be constants.
			</p>
      <li>How do parentheses affect the arithmetic outcome of an expression?</li>
      <p>
				Parentheses does affect the arithmetic outcome, by adding a parentheses it changes the value of the equation.
			</p>
      <li>How do we limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals?</li>
      <p>
				We can limit floating-point numbers to a given number of decimals by using the toFixed() method.
			</p>
      <li>How can we compare two floating-point values to see if they are equal (is 12.199999 the same as 12.2)?</li>
      <p>
				We can compare two floating-point values by using a small tolerance value, and check if the absolute difference between the two values is less than the tolerance value.
			</p>
      <li>What do comparison operators return, and how can we check if they are FALSE or TRUE?</li>
      <p>
				Comparison operators return a boolean value, either TRUE or FALSE, and we can check if they are FALSE or TRUE by using an "if" command.
			</p>
      <li>How does the Math.random() function work, and what can it be used for?</li>
      <p>
				The Math.random() function returns a random floating-point number between 0 (inclusive) and 1 (exclusice), and it can be used for generating random numbers for anything recuiring randomness.
			</p>
      <li>What is modulus (%), and when do we need this operator in mathematical operations?</li>
      <p>
        The modulus operator (%) is a operator that helps us when we want to find out if a number is even or odd, or when we want to wrap around a value within a certain range.			</p>
